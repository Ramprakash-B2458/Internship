2) Step-by-step processing and findings

1) Obtain a sample phishing email
- A fabricated sample (above) is used for safe training and analysis.
- Note: Never open attachments or click links from real phishing emails.

2) Examine sender's email address for spoofing
Checks:
- Compare display name and actual From address.
- Verify domain ownership (does the domain belong to the real organization?).

Findings (sample):
- Display name: Bank of America
- From address: support@bankofamerica-security.com (look-alike domain)
- Reply-To: secure-team@bofa-support.help (different domain)
- Verdict: Likely spoofed or look-alike domain.

3) Check email headers for discrepancies (use an analyzer)
Checks:
- Received chain to determine origin IPs and relays.
- Return-Path, DKIM, SPF, DMARC authentication results.

Findings (sample):
- Received chain indicates origin from smtp23.rusmail and IPs 198.51.100.45 / 198.51.100.23.
- Return-Path from mailer.russian-mail.net — unrelated.
- Authentication headers were not included in the sample; in practice, look for Authentication-Results: lines showing SPF/DKIM/DMARC pass/fail.

How to check (practical):
- Copy full headers and paste into an online header analyzer (search for "email header analyzer").
- Look for geographic or infrastructure mismatches (e.g., origin IP in Russia for a US bank).

4) Identify suspicious links or attachments
Checks:
- Dangerous attachment types: .exe, .scr, .bat, .zip (with executables inside).
- Links where displayed text differs from actual href.
- Links pointing to IP addresses or shorteners.

Findings (sample):
- Attachment: secure_doc.exe — malicious risk; banks do not send .exe.
- Visible link text: https://bankofamerica.com/login but actual href: http://198.51.100.23/bofa-login (IP + http) — link spoofing.

5) Look for urgent or threatening language
Checks:
- Time pressure phrases: "immediately", "within 24 hours", "suspend", "final warning".

Findings (sample):
- "verify your account within 24 hours or your account will be permanently suspended." — clear urgency.

6) Note any mismatched URLs (hover to see real link)
Technique:
- Hover over links in desktop mail clients; long-press on mobile to preview.
- Use URL scanners (VirusTotal, URLVoid) or open in a sandbox for analysis.

Findings (sample):
- Visible domain bankofamerica.com vs actual 198.51.100.23 — mismatch; also uses http not https.

7) Verify presence of spelling or grammar errors
Checks:
- Typos, grammar mistakes, poor punctuation or capitalization.

Findings (sample):
- "limitted" -> misspelling of "limited".
- Awkward phrasing — indicative of phishing.

8) Summary of phishing traits found
- Look-alike sender domain (bankofamerica-security.com) vs legitimate (bankofamerica.com).
- Reply-To uses a different suspicious domain (bofa-support.help).
- Received path and return-path from unrelated hosts/IPs.
- Suspicious executable attachment (secure_doc.exe).
- Link anchor text spoofing with href pointing to an IP (http://198.51.100.23/...) over plaintext HTTP.
- Urgent/threatening language to force quick action.
- Spelling/grammar mistakes.
- Overall verdict: High-confidence phishing attempt.
